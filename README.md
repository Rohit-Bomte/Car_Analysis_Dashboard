‚Ä¢	Radar Chart: Avg Horsepower, MPG, Weight, Cylinders, and Engine Size by Make.
‚Ä¢	Bubble Chart: Weight vs Length vs Engine Size for each Make.
‚Ä¢	Stacked Column Chart: Drivetrain distribution by Make.
Insights:
‚Ä¢	Brands like Toyota and Honda dominate in efficiency and price.
‚Ä¢	Luxury brands (like BMW, Audi) offer high performance with higher MSRP.
‚Ä¢	Drivetrain options vary across brands‚Äîsome specialize in AWD or RWD systems.
‚úÖ Drill-through Enabled: Clicking on a Make leads to model-level analysis for deeper insight.

5. Model-Level Decision Page
Objective:
To provide a detailed, comparative view of individual car models to help users finalize their choice based on their preferences.
Key Visualizations:
‚Ä¢	Table: All model attributes (Make, Type, Horsepower, MPG, Weight, MSRP).
‚Ä¢	Scatter Plot: Horsepower vs Weight to assess acceleration potential.
‚Ä¢	KPI Cards:
o	üí∞ Best Budget Car: MIN(MSRP)
o	üõ£Ô∏è Best Fuel Efficiency: MAX(MPG_City)
o	üèéÔ∏è Most Powerful: MAX(Horsepower)
o	üöê Best Comfort: MAX(Wheelbase) and MAX(Weight)
‚Ä¢	Multi-row Cards: Final recommendation shortlist based on filtered criteria.
‚Ä¢	Gauge Chart: Composite score of overall performance, affordability, and comfort.
Insights:
‚Ä¢	Drill-through filters allow users to dynamically adjust preferences (budget, power, efficiency) and shortlist the most suitable models.
‚Ä¢	Models offering the best trade-offs across multiple dimensions are highlighted clearly, helping users make a confident choice.

6. Conclusion
This analysis offers a 360-degree view of car performance across regions, types, brands, and models. By leveraging drill-through capabilities, users can seamlessly move from broad-level comparisons to specific model evaluations. The KPI cards, composite visualizations, and interactivity are designed to support real-world decisions like:
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhich car offers the best mileage under ‚Çπ20 lakh?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhich SUV brand is the most powerful and spacious?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best overall car for comfort and price balance?‚Äù
